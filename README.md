# SpaceInvadersAI
Code for teaching an AI how to play Space Invaders with Keras and OpenAI gym. 

This is my project on training a model to play Space Invaders with stable baselines 3 and gym! Initially I used KerasRL and Tensorflow to try and create a model. That process was slow and quite complicated, and in the end, I had a script that could get the average score to about 250, and it would not get reliably higher than that. The average score for a random agent is about 150, and here is an example:

My trained keras model was not exactly great, and required a lot of time to train it. If anybody wants to try, the script I was using is in the main branch, Keras Script is the file name.
